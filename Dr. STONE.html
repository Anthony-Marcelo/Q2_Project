				<p> I feel as though I need to start off with <span style="color: rgba(252, 156, 66, 1.0);font-family: fantasy; font-weight: bolder;"> Dr. STONE </span> as it is my <i>favorite</i> anime by far! 
				<br>
				<br>
				In summary, <span style="color: rgba(252, 156, 66, 1.0);font-family: fantasy; font-weight: bolder;"> Dr. STONE </span> takes place in a post-apocalyptic world wherein everyone was petrified and stayed in their stone cases for 3700 years. The first man to ever break out of the stone was Senku and his immediate goal was to start rebuilding civilization due to mother nature eroding all that humanity built.
				<br>
				<br>
				Long story short, in episodes 3 and 4, they head off towards Hokkaido in search for volcanic springs because there, they would find what they need to create gunpowder. They need to gunpowder in order to negotiate with an ally turned traitor of theirs. They end up in a spot where they have a stunning view of Mt. Fuji.
				<br>
				<br>
				<span style="color: rgba(252, 156, 66, 1.0);font-family: fantasy; font-weight: bolder;"> Dr. STONE </span> is an anime with Science at its heart and because of this, many of the scenery in it has a realistic touch. It is exactly the scientific and realistic aspect of this anime that I fell in love with in the first place, which is why I believe it deserves the first album in my hall of fame. </p>
